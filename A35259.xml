         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>NEver yet were any Nation or People ſo Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, who by the Inſtinct of Nature have not alwaies believed a certain Deity; and the denying thereof was accounted ſo deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, abſurd, and contrary to Humane Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, even among the Antient Heathen, that they reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to be horrible Blaſphemy. The <hi>Athenians</hi> baniſhed <hi>Protagoras</hi> both from their City and Country, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Books to be openly burnt becauſe in one of them he ſeemed to doubt of a Deity: 'Neither were they leſs ſevere toward <hi>Diagoras,</hi> ſirnamed <hi>The Atheiſt,</hi> who being accuſed of Atheiſm, fled for fear of puniſhment; upon which they proclaimed, <hi>That whoſoever did kill him, ſhould have a Talent of Silver in Recompence,</hi> which is as much as ſix hundred Crowns: How much more then is the State of Chriſtendom to be lamented, which is generally infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this Contagious Peſtilence? And how many bold and impudent Atheiſts are there in theſe Times, who daringly and confidently deny the Providence of God! believe not the Immortality of the Soul! think there is no ſuch thing as a Life to come! and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently they live like Swine and brute Beaſts in the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102782:5"/>world, wallowing in all manner of Luſts and Senſuality! But let ſuch mad, and brutiſh Wretches know, that they ſhall one day be convinced of their folly, when it is too late: And they may likewiſe find by the following In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which are of undoubted truth and certainty, that the Divine Juſtice doth ſometimes execute his ſevere Judgments upon them in this world, and makes them Monuments of Vengeance, for deterring others, <hi>That they may hear, and fear, and do no more ſo wickedly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. A certain Blaſphemous Wretch being drinking and merry at a Common Inn, among his Companions, asked them, <hi>Whether they thought a man was poſſeſſed with a Soul, or no?</hi> To which ſome replyed, <hi>That the Souls of Men were Immortal, and that ſome of them after their releaſe from the Body, lived in Heaven, and others were condemned to Hell, as we are taught from the Writings of the Prophets and Apoſtles;</hi> but he replyed, and ſwore, <hi>He did not believe the Soul did ſurvive the Body, but that Heaven and Hell were meer Fables, invented by the Prieſts to get money; and as for his part, he would ſell his Soul to any who would buy it.</hi> Then one of his Companions took up the Cup, and ſaid, Sell me thy Soul for this Cup of Wine, which he conſented to, and drank it off: Now the Devil himſelf was there in the ſhape of a man (as he is commonly not far from ſuch Debauchees) who bought it again of the other man at the ſame price; and ſoon after peremptorily demanded his Soul; the whole company affirming it was fit he ſhould have it, ſince he bought it, not knowing who it was that asked it: But on a ſudden this Infernal Merchant laid hold of this wretched Soul-Seller, and carried him into the Air before them all, toward his own Habitation, to the great aſtoniſhment and amazement of the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, and was never after heard of; but no queſtion found to his coſt that men had Souls, and that Hell was no Fable, contrary to his prophane and ſenſleſs Opinion. <hi>Diſcipul. de temp. Serm.</hi> 132.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Not inferiour to the former was the Impiety of one not many years ſince in this Nation, called <hi>Marlin,</hi> a Scholar by Profeſſion, brought up from his Youth in the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102782:5"/>Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and afterwards a ſcurrilous Poet, and Play-maker, who giving the Reins to his Wit and Fancy, ran into ſuch Extreams, that he denied God, and Jeſus Chriſt, and blaſphemed the Trinity, not onely in words, but as it is credibly reported, writ Books againſt it, affirming our Saviour to be a Deceiver, and <hi>Moſes</hi> a Seducer of the People, and the holy Scriptures to be but vain and idle Stories, and all Religion to be only a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick Cheat and Device: But Heaven, by an eminent Judgment, ſtopt the mouth of this Blaſphemer; for it happened, that as he intended to have ſtabbed a perſon, whom he had malice againſt, the other perceiving it, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided the ſtroke; and withal catching hold of his wriſt, he ſtabbed in his own Dagger into his own head, which wounded him in ſuch a terrible manner, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the help of Chirurgery, he died ſoon after, and that in a very ſad condition; for he curſed and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed to the laſt gaſp; and his laſt breath paſſed out of his body with an horrid Oath, to the terrour of all that beheld him; and herein did the Divine Juſtice remarkably appear, in that his own hand which had written thoſe Blaſphemies, was made an Inſtrument to puniſh that head and brain, which had wickedly deviſed them. <hi>Beards Theatre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. In the year 1527. A young <hi>Italian,</hi> eſteemed a man very brave, and valiant in Arms, was to fight with another young man, who (becauſe he was melancholy, and ſpake very little) was called <hi>Forchebene;</hi> they went together with a great company to the Place appointed, which was without the Port of St. <hi>Gall;</hi> whither being come, a friend to the former went to him, and ſaid, <hi>God give you the Victory;</hi> the proud young man adding blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy to his Temerity, anſwered, <hi>How ſhall he chuſe but give it me:</hi> They came to uſe their weapons, and after many blows given and taken both by the one and the other; <hi>Forchebene</hi> being become as the Miniſter and Inſtrument of God, gave him a thruſt in the mouth, with ſuch force, that having faſtened his Tongue to the Poll of his Neck (where the Sword went thorow, above

               </argument>
               <p>THat there are really Magicians, Conjurers, and Witches, who have commerce, and familiarity with evil Spirits, is ſo clear, and plain, both from holy Scripture, Councils, Canon &amp; Civil Laws in all Nations, that none but thoſe Atheiſts who would endeavour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade themſelves there are no Spirits, and conſequently no other Life after this, ever denied it, but ſince the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of this converſe with <hi>Demons,</hi> and their appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Poſſeſſions has been ſo clearly demonſtrated in former Ages, but eſpecially in this, by perſons of moſt acute judgment and Learning, wherein they have fully anſwered all Objections to the contrary, I ſhall not now ingage in the leaſt in the controverſy, but ſhall only give an account of the miſerable deaths of ſome Perſons mentioned in Hiſtory, who were concerned in theſe cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Arts, and likewiſe of ſome remarkable Apparitions, and actions of evil Spirits, and their taking poſſeſſion of the Bodies of ſeveral Perſons, and tormenting them; with ſeveral other ſtrange Feats, and illuſions of Satan, as I have collected them from very credible and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Authors; together with the danger of thoſe who are ſo vainly curious in knowing future events, as to enquire, or aſk Counſel of any of theſe Sorcerers, which is ſo ſtrictly forbid in the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>Saul,</hi> the firſt King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> being much diſturbed in mind for fear of the Army of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> which came againſt him, would by all means know aforehand the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:102782:20"/>iſſue of this doubtful War; now whereas before whil'ſt he performed the duty of a good King, and obeyed the Commandments of God, he had cleanſed his Realm of Witches and Inchanters; yet he is now ſo ſenſleſs, as in his extremity to aſk Counſel of them, adding this wickedneſs to all the reſt of his Sins, that the meaſure thereof might be full; he went there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to a Witch to know his Fate, who cauſed a Devil to appear to him in the ſhape of <hi>Samuel,</hi> and foretel him of Gods juſt Judgment upon him in the final ruine and deſtruction of himſelf and his Family. An example not much unlike this in the Event we find recorded of <hi>Natholicus</hi> the 31 King of the <hi>Scots,</hi> who after he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly uſurped the Crown and Scepter, and by much blood-ſhed had obtained the Throne of that Kingdom without any legal Right or Title thereunto, he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by the ſame means to confirm and eſtabliſh the Government to himſelf, and therefore, as guilt is always accompanied with ſuſpition and ſear, he ſent one of his truſtieſt Servants to a Witch, to enquire of things to come, both how long he ſhould enjoy the Crown, and how many years he ſhould live; the Witch anſwered, <hi>That he ſhould not live long, but ſhould ſhortly be murdered, not by his Enemy, but by his familiar Friend;</hi> and when the Meſſenger was very earneſt to know who ſhould kill him, ſhe anſwered, <hi>He himſelf ſhould do it;</hi> the man at firſt heard this with deteſtation, abhorring the thought of any ſuch Villany, yet at length conſidering that it was not ſafe to diſcover the Witches anſwer, and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide that it could not be long concealed, he reſolved for his own ſecurity, rather to kill the Tyrant with the favour of many, than to ſave him alive with the hazard of his own head; therefore as ſoon as he was returned home, he deſired the King that he might ſpeak with him in private about the Witches anſwer, &amp; there he ſuddenly ſlew him, &amp; gave him his juſt deſert, both for his horrible cruelty, and wicked Sorcery; let all thoſe that make no conſcience of running to Witches, either for loſt goods, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convery of their own or Friends health, or upon any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſion, remember this example, either for their
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:102782:21"/>inſtruction to amend, or for their terrour if they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue that deviliſh practice, <hi>Buchan. Hiſt. Scot. lib.</hi> 4.</p>

As divers very worthy Authors have credibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated ſeveral wicked actions committed by Magicians, &amp; Witches, ſo ſome of them have recorded the manner of their entring themſelves into that curſed profeſſion, and the Ceremonies thereof, as they have been diſcovered by thoſe who have renounced thoſe deteſtable practices, which it may not be improper here briefly to relate. The Wizards and Witches being met at a place and time appointed, the Devil there appears to them in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhape, admoniſhing them to be faithful, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them ſucceſs and length of Life; then thoſe that are preſent, recommend the Perſon who is to be entred; the Devil then requires him to renounce the Chriſtian Faith, and Sacraments, and giving him his hand, tells him that this alone is not ſufficient, but that he muſt worſhip him likewiſe, and give himſelf to him Body and Soul for ever, and bring as many as poſſibly he can into the ſame So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and that he muſt prepare himſelf certain Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and then be confirmed therein. <hi>Manlius</hi> writes, that in the Year 1553, Two Witches ſtole a Neighbours Child, and murdering it, cut it in pieces, and put it into a Kettle to boil, when the ſorrowful Mother looking for her Infant, came by chance into the houſe, &amp; found the Limbs thereof horribly conſumed; for which abominable Fact the Authors of it were burnt, having confeſſed this their villany. Another Author ſays, two other Witches are reported to have killed abundance of Children, and that in <hi>Germany</hi> Eight Witches were taken, who confeſſed they had murdered an hundred forty and five Children in making their Ointments; they are alſo reported to have each of them a Spirit or Imp attending on them, who are to aſſiſt and obey them in all things, and to give them notice of their ſolemn Meetings, or appointments, at which time it is ſaid, they ſeparate themſelves from all company, and night being come, they ſtrip them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves naked, ane anoint themſelves with their Ointments; then are they carried out of the houſe, either by the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:102782:21"/>door, or Chimney, mounted on their Imps, to their meeting place, which is ſometimes many hundred miles from their dwellings, where they find great numbers of Wizards and witches arrived by the ſame means, who all make their accuſtomed reverence to <hi>Lucifer</hi> in his Throne, adoring him, proclaiming him their Lord and rendring him all honour, as their King; this Solemnity being finiſhed, they fit at Table, where no delicate meats are wanting to pleaſe their appetites, after which they dance, and the Incubuſſes in the ſhape of proper men ſatisfy the luſts of the Witches, and the Succubuſſes ſerve for Whores to the Wizards; ſometimes at their ſolemn Aſſemblies the Devil commands each to tell what wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs he hath done, and according to the deteſtableneſs thereof, he is honoured and applauded; theſe, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other ſuch wonderful things are mentioned by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of good credit, and ſeveral Perſons have made Confeſſion, and given an account thereof.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Perreaud</hi> told Mr. <hi>Du Moulin,</hi> that a grave Divine once coming to his houſe, and hearing the Devil ſpeak profanely, rebuked him ſharply for it, whereupon the Devil anſwered, <hi>Miniſter, you are very holy and zealous in this Company, but you were not ſo, when you were ſinging ſuch a baudy ſong, in ſuch a Tavern,</hi> and then the Devil ſung the ſame ſong before them all; the Divine ſaid, <hi>It's true Satan, I have been licentious in my younger years, but God of his Mercy hath given me repentance, and pardon for it, but for thy part thou art hardned in ſin, and ſhalt never have repentance and pardon;</hi> he ſpake alſo of thoſe that: profeſſed the Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in <hi>France,</hi> ſaying, <hi>O poor Hugonots, you ſhall have much to ſuffer within a few years, O what miſchief is intended againſt you.</hi>

               <p>An Officer, who was a Papiſt, belonging to a Court of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:102782:32"/>Juſtice came out of curioſity to Mr. <hi>Perreauds</hi> houſe, and hearing that the Devil foretold future things, and ſome ſecrets, he would needs queſtion him about many mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; but Mr. <hi>Perreaud</hi> deſired him to forbear, repreſenting to him both the ſin and danger of it; the Lawyer rejected his Council with ſcorn, bidding him <hi>Teach his own Flock, and let him have the Government of himſelf,</hi> and ſo proceeded to propound ſeveral queſtions to the Devil, as about abſent Friends, private buſineſs, News, and State-Affairs, unto all which the Devil anſwered him, and then added, <hi>Now Sir I have told you all that you have demanded of me, I muſt tell you next what you demanded not, that at this very time you are propounding theſe queſtions to the Devil, ſuch a man (whom he named) is doing your buſineſs with your Wiſe;</hi> and then he further diſcovered many ſecret, and foul practiſes of the Lawyer, which ſhewed his diſhoneſty; neither was this all; for in concluſion the Devil told him, <hi>Now Sir let me correct you for being ſo bold as to queſtion with the Devil, you ſhould have taken the Miniſters ſafe Counſel;</hi> then upon a ſuddain the whole Company ſaw the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer drawn by the Arm into the midſt of the Room, where the Devil whirled him about, and gave him many turns with great ſwiftneſs, touching the ground only with his Toe, and then threw him down upon the floor with great violence, and being taken up, and carried to his houſe, he lay ſick and diſtracted a long time after.</p>
               <p>It ſeems at this time Satan was let looſe in <hi>France;</hi> for about the ſame time the Devil appeared at <hi>Lyons</hi> in the ſhape of a fine Gentlewoman, to the Lieutenant of the Knight of the Watch, called <hi>La Jacquiere,</hi> and to two others of his Companions, which three had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal knowledge of her, and thereby came to a moſt Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical and fearful end. At the ſame time a Perſon of Quality at <hi>Paris,</hi> had Cohabitation with the Devil in the ſhape of a beautiful Lady, who being viſited by ſome Juſtices and Phyſicians, was found to be the Body of a Woman hanged ſome few daies before: And at this time the Priſons in <hi>Maſcon</hi> were filled with a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Men and Women, young and old, all Indicted of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:102782:32"/>Witchcraft, who appealed to the Parliament at <hi>Paris;</hi> and as they went thither under a Guard, a Coach met them, and in it one like a judge, who aſked the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain what Priſoners he conducted; the Captain having ſatisfied him, he called to one of them by name, ſaying, <hi>How now! Art thou one of them too? Fear nothing; for neither thou, nor any of thy Company ſhall ſuffer:</hi> And theſe words proved true; for ſoon after they were all releaſed.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe about the ſame time a Girl at <hi>Maſcon,</hi> of about thirteen years old, who was Daughter to one of the Chief Citizens, lying with the Maid, perceived that ſhe abſented her ſelf many times in the night, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore aſked her whence ſhe came? the Maid anſwered, <hi>That ſhe came from a place where there was good Company, gallant Dancing, and all kind of Sport and Merriment:</hi> The Girl deſired the Maid to bring her alſo to that place, and accordingly ſhe anointed her, and made her do the Ordinary Ceremonies preſcribed by the Devil to Witches; after which the Girl was carried up into the Air; but ſeeing her ſelf above the Convent of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puchin</hi> Fryers, ſhe called upon God for help, who cauſed the Devil to lay her down in the Fryers Garden about midnight: The <hi>Capuchins</hi> hearing her lamenting voice went to her, to whom ſhe related theſe Paſſages, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon two of them ſecretly conducted her to her Fathers Houſe. At the ſame time alſo the Devil haunted the houſe of a Woman-Baker in <hi>Maſcon,</hi> in the ſhape of a Man with a Red Cap on his head, and would often look out of the Window by Moon-light, and was ſeen by many. Alſo the Devil kept a great ſtir in St. <hi>Stephens</hi> Church in <hi>Maſcon,</hi> overturning divers Graves, which many reſort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſee. He did the like alſo in the Church of St. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban,</hi> at the ſame time: And in a Widdows Houſe not far from <hi>Maſcon,</hi> he did much hurt, for three months together letting out the Wine in the Cellar, and beating ſeveral Perſons outragiouſly: And among others a Lock-Smith, who coming drunk into the Houſe, gave many ill and threatning words to the Devil, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently took one of the Andirons, and therewith grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:102782:33"/>beat him, till in great haſt he run away out of the Houſe.</p>
               <p>The ten or twelve laſt daies the Devil threw ſtones about Mr. <hi>Perreauds</hi> Houſe continually, from morning to evening, and in great quantity ſome of them of two or three pounds weight: One of thoſe laſt daies Mr. <hi>Tornus</hi> went to Mr. <hi>Perreauds</hi> Houſe, to know whether the Devil was there ſtill; and whiſtling ſeveral tunes, the Devil ſtill anſwered him in the ſame; then the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil threw a ſtone at him, which falling at his feet, he took up, marked it with a Coal, and threw it into the back-ſide of the Houſe, and preſently the Devil threw it at him again; when he took it, up, he ſound it very hot, whereupon he ſaid, <hi>That he believed it had been in Hell ſince he handled it firſt.</hi> The 22th of <hi>December</hi> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil went quite away; and the next day a great Viper was ſeen going out of Mr. <hi>Perreaud</hi>'s Houſe; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcovered by ſome Nailors that lived by, they ſeized it with long Pincers, and carryed it all over the Town crying, <hi>Here is the Devil that came out of the Miniſters Houſe,</hi> and then lift it with one Mr. <hi>Clark,</hi> an Apothecary, and it was found to be a True und Natural Viper; a Serpent rarely ſeen in thoſe Countries. All the while the Devil haunted Mr. <hi>Perreauds</hi> Houſe, God ſuffered him not to do the leaſt hurt either to their Perſons or Goods.</p>
               <p>This is a brief Account of ſome particulars, the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative whereof was drawn up more at large by Mr. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaud</hi> himſelf, a Reverend and Religious Divine, and is atteſted by ſo many, and thoſe ſuch credible Witneſſes, as the Truth of it cannot rationally be queſtioned by any.</p>
               <p>Conſidering therefore the notable Pranks played by the Devil and his Diſciples, it might ſeem ſtrange that there is no more hurt done in the world, did we not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that their Power, and that of their Black Maſter himſelf alſo is ſo limited and reſtrained by a Superiour hand of Goodneſs, that he cannot perform what his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p n="1">I. <hi>Ptolomeus Piſco,</hi> one of the Kings of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> cauſed his own Son <hi>Memphites</hi> (whom he had begot of his Wife &amp; Siſter <hi>Cleopatra</hi>) to be ſlain, and then commanded his Head, Hands, and Feet to be cut off, and to be ſhut up in a curious Casket, made for that purpoſe, and ſent them to his Mother, as a preſent upon his Birth-day; and when afterward he perceived that by his barbarous Tyranny
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:102782:65"/>he was grown odious to all his Subjects, to prevent the danger thereof, he cauſed a School where moſt of the Children of the Nobility, and others were educated, to be beſet, and incompaſſed round with fire, and men with drawn Swords, and then ſuddenly aſſaulted them, whereby they were all deſtroyed, not one of them eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping; but that which he thought to be his refuge, prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ruine, for the People were ſo extreamly incenſed with this cruel Act, that with an unanimous conſent they fell upon him, and tore him to pieces. The like, if not greater Cruelty was practiſed by a Woman, one <hi>Cycenis,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Diogerides,</hi> King of <hi>Thrace,</hi> who took great delight in beholding living men cut in the middle, and invited Parents to feaſt upon their own murthered Children, cookt and dreſt ſeveral ways, but ſhe was afterward depoſed from her Government, and her Inhumanities were ſo hateful, that none of her Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects would relieve her, whereby ſhe was famiſht to death, and dyed of hunger. <hi>Vitaldus,</hi> Prince of <hi>Lithua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> ſtudied divers ſorts of Tortures and Torments for men, whom upon every ſlight occaſion he condemned to death; among the reſt he would command them to be ſowed up in Bear-ſkins, and then made it his ſport to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them torn in pieces with fierce Maſtives; in all his warlike expeditions, he carried continually a Steel-bow, ready bent, and if any Souldier happened but to ſtep out of his Rank, he inſtantly ſtroke him dead with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, glorying to himſelf that he was ſo good a markſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; but after theſe, and abundance of other Cruelties, he that delighted to ſee men die like Bears, was himſelf in the end torn in pieces with wild Wolves, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited much in the ſame manner as he had exerciſed Barbarities upon others. <hi>Beards Theatre.</hi>

The Nobleman was herewith very ſtrangely ſurprized, having obſerved nothing but tenderneſs, and affectionate kindneſs in his Lady toward him; nor could he ever tax her with the leaſt wanton carriage, or laſcivious glance; yet he remembred when he went out early to Hunt, or Hauk, or ſurvey his Parks and Grounds, he found her many times hardly up, or ready to go to Breakfaſt when he came back, and his jealouſie ſuggeſted to him, that in this time this wickedneſs might be committed; and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing full of thoughts, he left her.
